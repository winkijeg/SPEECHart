function [ u, v ] = segment_contains_point_2d ( p1, p2, p )

%% SEGMENT_CONTAINS_POINT_2D reports if a line segment contains a point in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    A line segment is the finite portion of a line that lies between
%    two points.
%
%    In exact arithmetic, point P is on the line segment between
%    P1 and P2 if and only if 0 <= U <= 1 and V = 0.
%
%    Thanks to Lars Cremean for corecting a MATLAB error in which
%    elementwise multiplication was needed.

%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real P1(2), P2(2), the endpoints of the line segment.
%
%    Input, real P(2), a point to be tested.
%
%    Output, real U, the coordinate of P3 along the axis from
%    with origin at P1 and unit at P2.
%
%    Output, real V, the magnitude of the off-axis portion of the
%    vector P3-P1, measured in units of (P2-P1).
